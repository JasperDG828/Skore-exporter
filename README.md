# Skore-exporter
#### **Export your smartschool results to JSON or CSV**

### About
Inspired by the smartschool-feature for teachers to export their gradebooks to CSV, I wanted to create the same for pupils. If anybody from smartschool sees this, please natively implement this since my method is not entirely reliable yet.

### Privacy Policy
The Skore-exporter extension has access to all data on webpages in the browser. Only data on the results-page of smartschool will be accessed, but won't be stored and only gets used for functionality of the application.
