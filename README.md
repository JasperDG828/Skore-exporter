# Skore-exporter
#### **Export your smartschool results to JSON or CSV**

### About
Inspired by the smartschool-feature for teachers to export their gradebooks to CSV, I wanted to create the same for pupils. If anybody from smartschool sees this, please natively implement this since my method is not entirely reliable yet.

### Installation
Due to age restrictions, I am not able to publish this extension on the Chrome web store and a manual installation is required.
1) Download the source code of the latest release
2) Turn on developer mode in your chromium browser (Extensions > Developer mode)
3) Click 'Load Unpacked' in the extensions-tab
